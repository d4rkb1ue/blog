      <description>Socket in Unix/Linux  Socket in Unix/Linux is just file descriptor, which means you can just treat it as file. Socket exists on the both ends of the communicators as the endpoints. Socket can be full duplex. Since Socket are inherently file, then it has its own buffer for both Reading and Writing. The communication process is like,  Reading data from its reading buffer and write data to its writing buffer When the writing buffer is full(or call flush), the data will be passed to the peer&#39;s reading buffer Peer will refuse to be inputed when full    Socket Server/Client in Python  Server&#39;s serversocket.</description>

      <description>DNS In General DNS Server All DNS servers fall into one of four categories:
 Recursive Resolvers Root Nameservers TLD Nameservers Authoritative Nameservers  A recursive resolver (also known as a DNS recursor) is almost always the first stop in a DNS query. The recursive resolver acts as a middleman between a client and a DNS nameserver.

 DNS primarily uses UDP on port number 53 to serve requests.</description>

      <description>Case We want to combine two physical Network Interfaces(NIC) on a single machine, which,
 shares the same IP address, combines routing tables supporting circuit/swithing for different NICs, &amp;ldquo;extends&amp;rdquo; the upstream network(connected to NIC1) to be used by another device(connected to NIC2), eventually make the machine work tranparently as a network bridge.  Bridge in Linux How Linux handle net bridge in stacks For the Linux Kernel, normal user space processes can only utilize Socket with (IP, port, proto) 3-tuple for Network connection, which means that Kernel only provide L4 network communication interface.</description>
