      <description>DNS In General DNS Server All DNS servers fall into one of four categories:
 Recursive Resolvers Root Nameservers TLD Nameservers Authoritative Nameservers  A recursive resolver (also known as a DNS recursor) is almost always the first stop in a DNS query. The recursive resolver acts as a middleman between a client and a DNS nameserver.

      <description>Case We want to combine two physical Network Interfaces(NIC) on a single machine, which,
 shares the same IP address, combines routing tables supporting circuit/swithing for different NICs, &amp;ldquo;extends&amp;rdquo; the upstream network(connected to NIC1) to be used by another device(connected to NIC2), eventually make the machine work tranparently as a network bridge.  Bridge in Linux How Linux handle net bridge in stacks For the Linux Kernel, normal user space processes can only utilize Socket with (IP, port, proto) 3-tuple for Network connection, which means that Kernel only provide L4 network communication interface.</description>
